# Roblox-Hubs
( HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³)

After a year or so, I am back, and I am making some new Roblox hubs! I will be working on them as much as I can while focusing on school.

Break In 2 Hub Finished Features:
- Give Food: Click the dropdown and click your favourite food item you want. Then click it, then click the Give Food button to get it as much times as you want!
- Give Weapon: Click the dropdown under the next section, click your weapon, then click the button.
- Give Armor: Gives you the golden armor. No point having a dropdown for this.
- Other: Gives other stuff, such as a MedKit, Bottle (gym juice), etc
- Heal All - Heals everyone inside the game.
- Delete Scary Larry & Scary Mary - Deletes the final battle at the end and Scary Mary so you don't need to hear them yapping.
- Get Dog, Uncle Pete, etc - In the Help section, scroll down and you will see that you can get NPCs!
